-- Update to work under Enyo 2.0

MillenialMedia AdView

This is based on the documentation and samples for other platforms provided by Millenial Media, at 
http://www.millenialmedia.com/ .

usage:

Add mmAdView.js to your depends.js, prior to your main kind.  Add the following to your components list:

{ name: "AdView", kind: "MillenialMedia.AdView", apid: "*Your Assigned APID here*" }

That's basically it.  By default, the control will resize to fit the width/height of the received advertisement.
If this is not acceptable, you may specify autoResize: false within the component definition.

You may also specify additional metadata to provide to MM, as per their documentation, by passing it contained within
an object, as:

metadata: { "age":"25" }

In case it's ever needed, you can also specify the server to retrieve the advertisement from, as:

adserver: "ads.mp.mydas.mobi"

This advertising control does not automatically refresh on it's own -- I figured it would be better for the 
individual app authors to maintain their own refresh policies.  

To get a new ad, call: this.$.AdView.loadAd()

That is pretty much it.  After you configure a new APID from the MillenialMedia control panel, you will likely need
to wait several hours before their system will start serving ads to it.  

It appears from my initial testing, that if you specify "webOS" as the target operating system for your ads in 
the Millenial control panel, that you will nearly always receive a standard banner-sized 400x60 or thereabouts ad. 
You can specify an Android or iOS system in the app configuration, and receive different sizes and types of 
medias.  Hopefully they will begin to support these additional types and sizes of ads within webOS as well.

This has not undergone extensive testing, but it works for me.  Your mileage may vary.  If you find something that
doesn't work, or have any suggestions to enhance it, please feel free to let me know, or better yet, send a pull
request.
